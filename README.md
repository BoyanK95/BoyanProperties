# BoyanProperties

**A MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) Full Stack Real Estate Marketplace Project**

Welcome to BoyanProperties, a full-stack web application designed to create a comprehensive Real Estate Marketplace. This project is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB for the database, Express.js for the backend API, React for the frontend user interface, and Express for server-side logic.

## Project Overview ðŸ”¥ 

BoyanProperties aims to provide a platform for showcasing real estate properties and their associated details. At its core, the project will feature the following components:

- **CRUD Operations:** The application will support basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing property listings. Users will be able to add, view, edit, and remove property information.

- **Account Authentication:** User authentication will be a key feature, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and manage their own property listings. This will provide a personalized experience and ensure data security.

- **What we will be building:** :wrench: 

     **Advanced Authentication:** Implement JWT, Firebase, and Google OAuth for secure and seamless user access.
     **Real-world CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update, and delete property listings using MongoDB.
     **User-friendly Features:** Enhance the user experience with image uploads, property listing management, and more.
     **Advanced Search Functionality:** Implement cutting-edge search features to help users find what they're looking for.
     **Deployment Made Easy:** Learn to deploy your MERN real estate app for free using the 'render' platform.

 **Prerequisites:**

A basic understanding of JavaScript and React is recommended, but if you're eager to dive into full-stack development and excited about building a real estate marketplace, you're more than ready to get started.

## Development Status

As of now, development for BoyanProperties is just getting started. The project is in its early stages, and there's a lot of work ahead. We'll be building and refining the features mentioned above, as well as many others to create a robust Real Estate Marketplace.

## Getting Started

To get involved with the project or to run it locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. To run locally in the root folder run:
 ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
This will start the express server and connect to MongoDB,

After that to run the client side (frontend), go to the fronend folder:
 ```bash
  cd frontend
   ```
And once in the frontend folder run:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
   ```
This will spin up a development server with vite on port:5173
Open a browser and go to preview locally:
http://localhost:5173/

### Conclusion
BoyanProperties is a demonstration project created to hone and showcase my skills in developing full-stack applications using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. Throughout the development process, I focused on implementing fundamental real estate marketplace features, including CRUD operations, account authentication, and advanced search functionality.

#### Note:
BoyanProperties serves as a demonstration of my MERN stack development skills and is designed for learning purposes. It is a work in progress, and feedback or contributions are welcome. Feel free to explore the code, provide suggestions, and use it as a reference for your own projects. Happy coding! :computer:
